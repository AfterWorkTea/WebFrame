# WebFrame /Include

The folder contains PHP classes for rendering pages:

- Website.php - the framework engine
- WebDB.php - optional example of a database access class
- BasePage.php - the superclass for rendering content of pages
- LoginPage.php - optional for session log in
- Other *Page.php - subclasses of BasePage that render pages

## Website.php

The engine class for the framework. It processes requests according to provided configuration files, first renders common elements (like header, menu, footer, etc.) and later selects and calls specific Page's method getContent() to generate content's HTML.

## BasePage.php

The superclass for rendering pages. It provides the basic functions to handle attributes from XML definition, the default page name and process XML using given XLST to generate HTML content.

Other content rendering classes should extend it and implement own getContent() method.

## LoginPage.php

Simple mock for log in (user and password must be longer than 2 characters)

## Other *Page.php

The classes are responsible for rendering content the corresponding page. They are being called by Website and must extend BasePage and provide own:

- public function getContent() that will return HTML

## WebDB.php

This is an example class provided as illustration to interact with MySQL database by calling stored procedures/functions.

Please note the response from classes, that is an array generated by getResponce($return, $status). Regardless of result the array has the same form:

`["R" => $return, "S" => $status]`

Where:

- `['S']` represents status: 'OK' for success or any other not null string for an error
- `['R']` represents XML value for a success or message for an error

Please note the function `getZoo($sort, $gid, $from, $pagesize)`.

It takes arguments specific for database side sorting, filtering by an id and paging (from and page size)
